# specnaut-plugin — Claude Code plugin for Specnaut

This is the Claude Code plugin distribution of [Specnaut](https://specnaut.makerlabs.dev). It ships
the same slash-commands and sub-agents that the `specnaut` binary scaffolds into projects — just as
a user-scope plugin instead. `/specnaut specify "<feature>"` auto-chains the full workflow by
default; pass `--manual` to opt out.

The full plugin migration shipped in v0.12.x (issue
[#73](https://github.com/mkrlabs/specnaut/issues/73)). When the plugin is installed and the project
harness is `claude`, `specnaut upgrade` auto-migrates vanilla on-disk agents to the plugin (backs
them up, then removes them — the plugin serves them going forward). `specnaut check
--project` warns
about any plugin-covered files that are missing when the plugin is uninstalled.

### Known caveat: handoff IDs

The 10 command SKILL.md files include `handoffs:` frontmatter that references peer commands by their
**binary-scaffolded** IDs (`specnaut-plan`, `specnaut-clarify`, …). In plugin scope those IDs are
`specnaut-plugin:plan` etc., so the clickable handoff buttons may not resolve. For the full handoff
UX today, use the binary-scaffolded copies (run `specnaut init`) — the plugin versions are the
discoverability layer, not the polished workflow. Handoff rewriting is a known follow-up task on
#73.

## How this differs from `specnaut init`

- The plugin is **user-scope** and **versioned** — installed once, available across all your
  projects, updates via `/plugin update`.
- The binary's `specnaut init` scaffolds **project-scope** copies — you can customize them
  per-project, and they ship with shorter slash-command names (e.g. `/specify` instead of
  `/specnaut-plugin:specify`).
- Backlog skill, hooks, and `.specnaut/` files stay binary-owned because they read project-state at
  runtime.

## Install

```bash
/plugin install mkrlabs/specnaut-plugin
```

## Local development

To test changes to the plugin without publishing:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/specnaut/plugin
```

Then invoke any plugin skill: `/specnaut-plugin:specnaut specify "…"`.

## Versioning

The plugin's `version` field in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is kept in lockstep with the `specnaut`
binary by `scripts/bump-version.ts`, which is run as part of every `/release`. The release pipeline
(`.github/workflows/release.yml`) hard-fails on any drift between the two.
